I am a PhD student in [Computing and Mathematical Sciences at Caltech](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Houman Owhadi](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/index.htm). My main research area is Game-theoretical Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), both from a theoretical point of view and with applications to the Physical Sciences. I collaborate with scientists from the Machine Learning and Uncertainty Quantification groups at [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://jpl.nasa.gov/). Prior to joining Caltech, I graduated from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya with a double degree in Mathematics and Engineering Physics as part of the [CFIS program](https://cfis.upc.edu/en) and I was a research intern at the [Center for Data Science at NYU](https://cds.nyu.edu/) for 9 months.
